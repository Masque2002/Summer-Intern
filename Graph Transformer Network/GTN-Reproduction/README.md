# Reproduction-GTN

This repo is build to reproduce the experiments in [Graph Transformer Networks(GTN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.06455).

Information about **Dependency** and **Data** can be found in this [repo](https://github.com/seongjunyun/Graph_Transformer_Networks).

My Jupyter notebook file is GTN-reproduction.ipynb.

And I made a ppt to express my understanding of this paper.
